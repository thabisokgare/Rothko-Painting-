## Overview
This project is a simple, responsive **Photo Gallery** created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It showcases a collection of images, arranged neatly in a grid format. The gallery is designed to be responsive, adjusting seamlessly across various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

## Features
- **Grid Layout**: The gallery uses CSS Grid to display images in an organized and flexible layout.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on all devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover effects on the images enhance the user experience by providing interactivity.
- **Alt Descriptions**: Each image includes meaningful `alt` attributes for better accessibility and SEO.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Used to structure the webpage and display the images.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the gallery, including layout control (Grid/Flexbox), hover effects, and responsive design.

## Files and Directories
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the gallery and the images.
- `style.css`: Provides the styling rules for the gallery, making it responsive and visually appealing.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-gallery.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the photo gallery.
3. Modify the `style.css` file to change the layout, colors, or other styles.

## Example Code Snippets

### HTML Structure:
```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Description of image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Description of image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Description of image 3">
</div>
```

### Basic CSS for Grid Layout:
```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 10px;
}

.gallery img {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 5px;
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.gallery img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

## Future Improvements
- **Lightbox**: Add a lightbox effect to allow users to click on an image and view it in a larger format.
- **Filters**: Add image filtering options to let users sort by categories or tags.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Implement features like lazy loading, search, or slideshow functionality.
