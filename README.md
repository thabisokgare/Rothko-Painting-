 Rothko-Painting Project

Overview
This project is a web-based recreation inspired by the abstract works of Mark Rothko. It uses **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling to represent Rothko’s signature style of large blocks of color. The purpose of this project is to explore the intersection of art and web development, creating visually appealing and responsive digital interpretations of Rothko’s famous color field paintings.

Features
- **Minimalist Design**: The project emphasizes large, vibrant blocks of color reminiscent of Rothko's color field paintings.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring that the painting scales and adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Custom CSS**: All visual elements are styled using custom CSS, including background colors, gradients, and positioning.
- **HTML Structure**: The project leverages basic HTML5 elements to organize and structure the color blocks.
  
Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the basic structure and elements for the page.
- **CSS3**: Handles the visual layout, background color transitions, and responsiveness of the design.
  - Flexbox: Used for arranging and aligning the color blocks.
  - Gradients: Applied to create a smooth transition between color blocks, mimicking the soft edges seen in Rothko’s paintings.

 Files and Directories
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the layout of the painting.
- `style.css`: Contains all the custom CSS used for styling the color blocks and layout.

Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
